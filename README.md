# Recursive Floyds Algorithm
Floyd's algorithm finds the shortest path between all pairs
of vertices in a graph. 

Floyd's Algorithm has been rewritten to use recursion to complete 
a mid-module assignment for the Univerity of Liverpool.
PyCharm Community was used to develop this algorithm. 

Find a copy of the GeeksforGeeks interative algorithm
in imperative-algorithm.py

The recursive version of this algorithm can be found in the 
recursive-floyd.py file
