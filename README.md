# Recursive Floyds Algorithm
Floyd's algorithm finds the shortest path between 
all pairs of vertices in a graph. 

Floyd's Algorithm has been rewritten to use 
recursion to complete a mid-module assignment 
for the Univerity of Liverpool. PyCharm Community
was used to develop this algorithm. 

Find a copy of the GeeksforGeeks interative 
algorithm in imperative-algorithm.py

The recursive version of this algorithm can be 
found in the recursive-floyd.py file

## Testing 

The performance test can be found in 
performance_tetsing.py. The examples used for unit 
testing can be found in examples_for_testing.py
